/* 
ids can be given to any element on a page,
they usually should be unique
you give these ids styles in css by typing a hash "#"
and then the id name right after WITHOUT A SPACE.

classes can also be given to any element
however, they usually are not unique by element.
you can classes styles in css by typing a period "."
and then the classname followed by brackets and putting the 
styles inside those brackets

0,0,1 is for if you style elements directly using element name
0,0,1 is the second weakest to star selector which is 0,0,0

classes have a selector specificity of 0,1,0 which is 
stronger than 0,0,1

ids have the strongest which is 1,0,0

we can combine element, class, and id selectors to get
a higher selector specificity
for example: an element and a class would be 0,1,1
or a class and id would be 1,1,0
lastly an id a class and an element would be 1,1,1

the style html attribute, which is called inline styling
will overrule all other selector specificities
