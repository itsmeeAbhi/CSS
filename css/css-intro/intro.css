/*
when we target a specific html element... all elements on
the linked html page will be affected by those styles

use the curly braces "{}" after specifying what element
you want to style

put all the styles you want to effect the element inside the
curly braces-- if you dont... bad things happen :(

we need to add the colon after the property... the property is the
style name.

the values are what comes after the property and colon

semicolons at the end of each line are neccesary if you are done
writing code on that line

divs with nothing inside of them, usually have no height by default,
but do have a width. this is caused by browsers.

if you add an element that has a height by default in a div, the divs height will
become that height

pixels are just a tiny unit of measurement

we can use the star selector select all elements
and apply styles to all elements

we set the margin to 0 in the star selector to get rid of default
browser margins.
